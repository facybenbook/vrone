## About ZEISS VR ONE

ZEISS VR ONE is a head-mounted virtual reality device, compatible with various smartphones. For more information, please go to [http://zeissvrone.tumblr.com/](http://zeissvrone.tumblr.com/).

## What is the VR ONE SDK?

The VR ONE SDK is a VR SDK for Unity and aims to help developers to create great virtual reality experiences for the VR ONE head-mounted virtual reality device. For now, it supports mobile apps made with Unity3D for iOS and Android platforms. 

## What can I expect from the VR ONE SDK?

The VR ONE SDK features an open soure, MIT-licensed Unity package, which provides a *split sceen* and/or *stereo two-camera* setup and applies a *configurable radial and chromatic pre-distortion effect* to prepare the image for optimal display in the VR ONE for various smartphone models. 

The SDK is currently in an experimental stage. A final release as well as the complete code base will be provided once the VR ONE becomes available for sale.

## Wait, I can use the VR ONE SDK and sell my app without paying you a cent?

You got it. The VR ONE SDK is supposed to help you jumpstart your app development.

## When should I use VR ONE SDK?

If you are a developer who aims to develop or adapt your mobile app for VR ONE with Unity, you will be able to jumpstart your Unity project by utilizing the VR ONE SDK. If you are using native development in Android or iOS, we will shortly support you with tutorials in the VR ONE wiki.

## What are the requirements to use the Unity package?

For using the pre-distortion functionality, you need a Unity Pro license with at least a iOS or Android platform license. 

## Which smartphones are currently supported?

The VR ONE SDK will work with the *iPhone 6 as well as most recent Android 4 smartphones* right out of the box. 

To maximize user experience, we add pre-distortion effects optimized for dedicated smartphones. For beginning, we include pre-distortion support for the following models.

* Apple iPhone 6
* Samsung Galaxy S5

*Important note:* Compatibility is being extended in future. This list is being updated accordingly.

Please also check the availability of VR ONE smartphone drawers for certain models on the tumblr blog: http://zeissvrone.tumblr.com/

When your game targets iPhone use Unity 4.5.4p1 or later. In your PlayerSettings configuration provide all required launch images so that project will run at full resolution. Also set Target Device to iPhone only.

## Give me a Demo

The `<vronesdk.unitypackage>` can simply be dragged into an empty Unity project and the the scene in the Demo/Scenes folder can be opened. This will setup the VROneSDK and a Scene with a spinning cube and three lights.

## Getting started

Using the VR ONE SDK is very simple:

1. Download the `<vronesdk.unitypackage>` and drag it into your Unity project. The `<vronesdk.unitypackage>` provides the `VROneSDK` prefab in the `VROneSDK` folder. The VR ONE SDK is intended to replace the cameras in your scene. 
2. Drag the VR ONE SDK into your scene, and remove any other camera from your scene. 
3. You can then associate the `VROneSDK`, the `VROneSDKHead`, and its attached GameObjects with your custom scripts for head tracking and gameplay.

The VROne SDK requests 60fps on every device. Additionally interface orientation needs to be landscape left or right.

### Changing the camera distance (mono / stereo)

The camera view can be adjusted through the VROneSDK singleton. By simply
getting ahold of the shared instance and setting the IPD to the preferred
value.  A value of zero (0) would indicate that both cameras are on top of
each other and are rendering the identical image (e.g. mono). Increasing
the IPD value results in a stereo image with increasing distance between
the eyes.

*Example*

```
VROneSDK.sharedInstance.IPD = 0.0;
```

would produce a mono (two identical images side by side) view. Similarly

```
VROneSDK.sharedInstance.IPD = VROneSDK.VROneSDKDefaultIPD;
```

would set the IPD to `0.065` and result in a stereo view (the two images are
rendered from slightly differing viewports).


You can all well set `runsInStereoMode` to enable or disable mono-/stereo-mode:

```
VROneSDK.sharedInstance.runsInStereMode = true;
```

### Enabling / Disabling VR ONE
When user hasn't put on the VR ONE yet, use 

```
VROneSDK.sharedInstance.isVROneEnabled = false;
```

to disable splitting the view and present a regular screen to the user.
Only one camera will be used for rendering the scene and no distortion will be applied.

Once your game starts set this value to `true`  and thus enable the full VROne experience for the user.

### Disabling / Enabling the pre-distortion

The applied distortion can be disabled (e.g. for testing without the VR ONE)
if needed by deactivating the `VROne SDKLUTDistortion` script on the left
and right eye of the `VROneSDK.prefab`.
